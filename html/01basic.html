        <h1>BASIC HTML ELEMENTS</h1>
           <p>
            This is within paragraph element.So i'm here, wrapping  paragraph element with idk b*llsh*t.      
        </p>

        <h2>HEADING ELEMENTS</h2>
        <p>
            There are 6 different levels of headings starting from <b>h1 <i>to</i> h2</b>. The number within a heading tag represents that heading's level. The largest and most important heading is h1, while h6 is the tiniest at the lowest level.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see below, the difference between h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h5 
        </p>

        <h1> i am h1 </h1>
        <h2> i am h2 </h2>
        <h3>i am h3 </h3>
        <h4>i am h4</h4>
        <h5> i am h5 </h5>
        <h6> i am h6 </h6>


        <h2>STRONG & EM ELEMENTS</h2>
        <p> 
            Strong element makes text bold and semantically marks text as <strong>important</strong>. The em element makes text italic and also semantically places <em>emphasis</em> on the text. 
        </p>

        <h2>ABOUT NESTING AND INDENTATION</h2>   
        <p>
            When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child relationship between them. The nested elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use indentation to make the level of nesting clear and readable for ourselves and other developers who will work with our HTML in the future. It is recommended to indent any child elements by two spaces.
        </p>

        <h2>UNORDERED & ORDERED LISTS</h2>

        <p>If you want to have a list of items where the order doesnâ€™t matter, like a shopping list of items that can be bought in any order, then you can use an unordered list.</p>
        <p>If you instead want to create a list of items where the order does matter, like step-by-step instructions for a recipe, or your top 10 favorite TV shows, then you can use an ordered list.</p>

        <h3>Unordered Lists <small>(what i like)</small></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cat</li>
            <li>food</li>
            <li>sleep</li>
            <li>and idk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ordered lists <small>(my daily routine)</small></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>eat</li>
            <li>sleep</li>
            <li>repeat</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>ANCHOR ELEMENT</h2>
        <p>To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element.</p>
        <h3>Absolute and Relative Links</h3>
        <p>
            Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typica absolute link will be made up of following parts: <mark>protocol://domain/path</mark>
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.tenor.com%2FcyNmFWbyEBkAAAAM%2Fcat.gif&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftenor.com%2Fsearch%2Fcute-cat-gifs&tbnid=evE9GbyfbaeX0M&vet=12ahUKEwjm4OXphv37AhU5xnMBHfnzBPcQMygDegUIARCWAg..i&docid=8sC2L_1lPmGG6M&w=220&h=220&q=cat%20gif&ved=2ahUKEwjm4OXphv37AhU5xnMBHfnzBPcQMygDegUIARCWAg">absolute link example
        </a>

        <p>
            Links to other pages within out own website are called relative links. Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the samr site, it assumes the domain name will be the page we create the link on.
